# cartpole
Make a bot that can keep a cart pole steady. Here are two bots, that are using Deep Reinforcement Learning, the fist bot, which is cartpole-v0, is a bot that is randomly guesing to keep the pole steady, meaning that the bot is not using neural network, and might take many tryies to pass or few. 
The second bot, which is tf-cart is capable of passing the game with many intents or neural neural network, meaning that is like the first bot, but this time the bot is saving the data for it to know the best form of passing the game.
This code is written in Python 3.5, the libraries I am using that you might need to isntall are, gym, tensorflow, numpy, and metaplotlib.pyplot.
